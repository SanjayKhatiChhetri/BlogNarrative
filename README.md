# SUMMER PROJECT SPRING 2024
---------------------------

## Creating example web application for Web programming project course 
 
Objective for the project is to create an example web application for Web programming 
project course. Developed app will be used as an example for an assignment and target 
audience is first year students doing their first project course. Web programming project 
course is 15 credits containing both development work and project management.  
 
## Features 
 
Developed example app should be a social media app/forum/blog wher users are able 
to make posts, comment and like them. Following page contains list of all the features 
that must be included. It also contains points that will be used when evaluating returned 
assignments. 
 
Developed web application should be blog with multiple authors (same blog contains 
posts from multiple different users).  Topic (what website is about) is free/open.


| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Responsive UI | UI is scaling into different screen sizes (mobile, tablet or wider). Bootstrap is used to create layout and basic styling. |
| Appearance | UI should follow good design principles. There should be enough whitespace. The use of colours and fonts should be considered. |
| Registration | User must be able to sign up to the app using email address and password. |
| Login | User should be able to login to the app by using email address and password created during sign up. |
| Displaying posts | Web site should display posts. Post contains title, description, date, and author. Author is logged in user, who has created the post. Posts are visible for all users. |
| Adding posts | Logged user should be able to add posts. Author is logged user and date is automatically generated by the database. |
| Adding comments | Logged user is able add comment for a post. Author is logged user and comment contains text and date generated by the database. |
| Displaying comments | Comment count for a post is displayed in connection with other post information and a modal window is used to display comments (text, date and author). |
| Like | User can like a post. Likes are displayed in connection with other post information using stars (icons/images) and calculated average (number). |
| Adding image for a post | User can add an image for a post. Form data is used to send (binary) data from frontend to backend. Image file is saved on backend under public/image folder. |
| Displaying post image | Saved post image is displayed in connection with the post. |
| Deleting posts | Logged user can delete own posts. All data related to posts (e.g. comments) are also deleted. |
| Editing posts | Logged user can edit own posts. |
| Deleting comment | Logged user can delete own comments. |
| Editing comment | Logged user can edit own comments |
| Search/Filtering | User can search/filter displayed posts. |
| Encrypting password | Password is encrypted in database. |
| Authentication token | Authentication token (JWT) is used to protect all endpoints that requires user to be logged in. |
| Password recovery (NodeMail link with recovery link and related functionality) | User can recover password by requesting link to email. Link opens a page where password can be changed. |
| Static content | Web site should contain at least one static html page. |

## Technology

Technologies for the web application are as follows.  
- UI is implemented using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 
- Front-end  software  logic/functionality  is  implemented  using  Vanilla  JavaScript, 
no framework is allowed 
- Backend  is  developed  using  NodeJS  and  Express.  Database  connection  is 
implemented using pg library with async interface. Other possible libraries can 
be installed (e.g. Nodemon, Cors, etc.) 
- Database is PostgreSQL


## Requirements 
 
Web  application  (both  front-end  and  backend)  needs  to  be  well-structured  and 
commented. For the backend separate routes, files for handling database activities and 
middleware for handling authentication and errors are implemented.  Front-end should 
make use of object-orientation. All code is stored into Github repository with descriptive 
readme  file.  While  considering  technical  solutions,  keep  in  mind,  that  example 
application is used to teach first year students with limited previous knowledge or skills. 
Therefore, used solutions should be relatively simple.
